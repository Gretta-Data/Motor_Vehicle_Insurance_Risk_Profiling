Project Title:Motor Insurance Customer Profiling and Risk Segmentation

## Project Overview
The agency uses this project to analyze customer behaviour in the motor insurance dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis and clustering. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to assess whether premiums align with actual risk and whether customer segments are effectively identified and targeted to improve pricing, retention, and acquisition strategies.

##  Dataset
- **Source:** Insurance_Vintage_Data.csv
- Contains demographic and policy data including age, driving license status, vehicle age, damage history, etc.

## Objectives
- Understand customer characteristics through EDA.
- Segment customers using clustering (KMeans).
- Analyze annual premium trends across segments.
- Recommend strategies for risk-based pricing and retention.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Categorical encoding for gender, vehicle damage, and vehicle age.
   - Dropped irrelevant features like ID.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized relationships between vehicle damage and premium.
   - Examined age and premium distributions across groups.

3. **Clustering**
   - Applied KMeans to segment customers based on features.
   - Interpreted cluster characteristics to guide business action.

4. **Insights**
   - High-premium clients with clean driving records are potentially overcharged.
   - Low-risk, high-vintage customers could benefit from loyalty rewards.
   - Uninsured customer base presents a market opportunity.

##  Recommendations
- Adjust pricing models to align with customer risk profiles.
- Offer retention incentives to long-term, low-risk customers.
- Develop onboarding campaigns for previously uninsured segments.
